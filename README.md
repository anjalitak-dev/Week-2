# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System       
## Overview        
 This project is designed to assist in recommending suitable crops and fertilizers based on key soil and environmental parameters. It leverages a machine learning-based approach to ensure accurate predictions, ultimately aiding in sustainable agriculture.
           
# Problem Statement
The primary goal is to develop a system that:  
- 	Predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil composition and climatic conditions.
- Recommends appropriate fertilizers to optimize yield and soil health.
#  Dataset Description:  
  The dataset contains 2,200 samples and includes the following features:   
  ### Predictor Variables:     
   ####  •	N (Nitrogen): Nitrogen content in the soil (mg/kg).    
   ####  •	P (Phosphorus): Phosphorus content in the soil (mg/kg).      
  #### •	K (Potassium): Potassium content in the soil (mg/kg).     
   ####  •	Temperature: Atmospheric temperature (°C).      
   ####  •	Humidity: Relative humidity (%).       
   ####  •	pH: Soil pH level (acidity or alkalinity).      
   ####  •	Rainfall: Annual rainfall (mm).    
 # Target Variable:
-	Label: Recommended crop type (e.g., rice, maize, wheat, apple, coffee, etc.).

  
# Dataset Insights:
- The dataset has no missing or duplicate values.
- Each crop category is balanced, with 100 samples per class.
- Features exhibit a diverse range of values, ensuring variability.
